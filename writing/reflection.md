TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers and the prompts that go
along with them. When you are finished with this reflection it should contain
polished and correct technical writing that is suitable for publication on your

## Program Understanding

### Explain every component of the following function signature

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

`def compute_intersection(tuple_one: Tuple[Any, ...], tuple_two: Tuple[Any, ...]) -> Tuple[Any, ...]:`

### Why does the `compute_intersection` function return different outputs depending on its input order?

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

### Explain every component of the following function signature

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

`def apply_to_each(values: List[int], function: Callable) -> None`

### Why does the `apply_to_each` function not need to return a list?

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

### What are the affordances associated with higher-order functions like `apply_to_each`?

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

### What is the purpose of each of the following source code statements?

```python
intersection_tuple_one = compute_intersection(first_tuple, second_tuple)
intersection_tuple_two = compute_intersection(second_tuple, first_tuple)
print()
print(f"The first intersection tuple: {intersection_tuple_one}")
print(f"The second intersection tuple: {intersection_tuple_two}")
```
