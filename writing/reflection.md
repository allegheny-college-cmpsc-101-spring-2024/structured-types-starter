## Program Understanding

### Explain every component of the following function signature

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

`def compute_intersection(tuple_one: Tuple[Any, ...], tuple_two: Tuple[Any, ...]) -> Tuple[Any, ...]:`

### Why does the `compute_intersection` function return different outputs depending on its input order?

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

### Explain every component of the following function signature

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

`def apply_to_each(values: List[int], function: Callable) -> None`

### Why does the `apply_to_each` function not need to return a list?

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

### What are the affordances of a higher-order function like `apply_to_each`?

TODO: Provide a detailed response to this question.

### What is the purpose of each of the following source code statements?

```python
intersection_tuple_one = compute_intersection(first_tuple, second_tuple)
intersection_tuple_two = compute_intersection(second_tuple, first_tuple)
print()
print(f"The first intersection tuple: {intersection_tuple_one}")
print(f"The second intersection tuple: {intersection_tuple_two}")
```
